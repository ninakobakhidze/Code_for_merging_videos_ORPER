# Code_for_merging_videos_ORPER
This code was created to merge two videos together. In order to make this code work, you need to create a folder for each video sequences and name them "NSIN_the_dedicated_number", then in each folder put the videos you want to merge together and name them "part1", "part2", and "part3". The advantage of the code is that it is suitable for two and three sequences of video, you can change the code, absed on the number of sequences you have. ATTENTION! always merge videos of the same length at a moment. The code creates a third, merged, video in the same folder, while original videos stay intact.
